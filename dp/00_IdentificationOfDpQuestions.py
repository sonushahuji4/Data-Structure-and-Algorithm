# 1. Count the number of ways
# 2. There are multiple ways to do this, find min or max kindly of statments
# 3. Try all possible ways like count, best way etc
# 4. Best way to approach dp or recursion problems
#    Try to represent the problems in terms of index
#    Do all possible ways on that index according to the problem statement
#    If quesitons say count all ways then "sum up all staffs"
#    If questions says min of all staff then find min
#    if questions says max of all staff then find max
# 5. Recursion is basically top-down appraoch (Top-down -> ansswer -> base case)
# 6. Tabulation is basically bottom-up approach (Bottom-up -> base case -> requirement)
