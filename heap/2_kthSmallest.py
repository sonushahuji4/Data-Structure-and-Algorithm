# Given an array arr[] of size N and a number K, where K is smaller than the size of the array. 
# Find the Kâ€™th smallest element in the given array. Given that all array elements are distinct.

# Examples:  

# Input: arr[] = {7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15}, K = 3 
# Output: 7

# Input: arr[] = {7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15}, K = 4 
# Output: 10
