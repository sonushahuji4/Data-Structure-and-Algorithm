# Quesiton (Asked In Google) in 2nd round

  # A limited-time sale is currently ongoing for toys. Each day ith is represented by two parameters: A[i] denotes the sale end time, and B[i] represents the beauty of that day's offering.
  # The sale starts at time T = 0, and it takes one unit of time to purchase one toy. However, a toy can only be bought if the current time T is less than the sale end time A[i].
  # The goal is to maximize the sum of the beauty of the purchased toys.
